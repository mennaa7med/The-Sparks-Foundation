                <p>Please support us to reach children and families affected by the devastating earthquake.
                    Donate to help send emergency food support.</p>
                <p>Destructive earthquakes have hit the border region between Turkey and Syria, killing thousands and
                    injuring many more.
                    These earthquakes have devastating results for areas that were already suffering because of the
                    Syrian crisis.</p>
